The term transparent denotes something translucent, where light can shine through. 
It is, for example, used in context of economics (transparent markets), meaning markets where much is known by many, 
and nothing is hidden. Sometimes geeks tend to inverse this meaning, saying transparency where they mean opaqueness. 
This post illustrates that your favorite XY-framework by no means makes XY transparent for developers.
