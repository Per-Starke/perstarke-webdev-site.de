This article gives an overview of art styles (more precisely: painting styles), based upon computer-generated images.
It demonstrates a few capabilities of current AI-based generation systems, namely:

- [DALL.E](https://labs.openai.com/) 
- [midjourney](https://midjourney.com)
- [Craiyon](https://www.craiyon.com/)

# Introduction
For reasons only understood by some dark force, I decided to use the popular Yoda figure as the recurring subject.

In case you want to 
- see more Yoda images, please refer to my ART-ificial Yoda gallery, showing fictional and generated Yoda portraits by different artists, sorted by painters' age.
- read more about art styles with _real_ paintings, see
   - this [simplicable article](https://simplicable.com/new/art-styles) or
   - this [artland article](https://magazine.artland.com/art-movements-and-styles/#minimalism)
  
And now, without further ado, let's dive into art styles. As I got completely overwhelmed by the vast number of different styles I encountered when I started researching for this post, I decided to sort them alphabetically, instead of historically.

# Art Styles

## Abstract Art
Abstract art does not attempt to represent an accurate depiction of a real entity, but instead uses shapes, colours and forms.
